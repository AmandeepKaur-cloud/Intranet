An intranet is like a private version of the internet that is used within a specific organization, such as a company or school. It allows people in that organization to share information, communicate, and access resources securely.

Think of it as a closed-off area where only members of that organization can go online to find documents, send messages, or use special tools that help them do their jobs better. Unlike the internet, which anyone can access, an intranet is only for those who are part of that group.
