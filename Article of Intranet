The start of intranets traces back to the early days of computing when organizations used internal networks for communication and information-sharing among employees.
When intranets first came onto the digital scene, they were very rudimentary, serving basic functions, such as storing company-wide data and broadcasting information from a central location. Whether they were built or bought, they werenâ€™t designed for collaboration
Key features of intrant:
 Content (eg. policy documents); 

2) Communications (eg. corporate news); 

3) Activity (eg. expense form); 

4) Collaboration (eg. project wiki); and 

5) Culture (eg. noon-hour jogging club).
